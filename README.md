     name: 'Honeycomb Attuned',
     level: 1,
     effects: [{ type: 'reputation_boost', value: 10 }]
   }
   ```

3. **On-Chain Progression**
   ```typescript
   // Every action creates a blockchain transaction
   const transaction = await createBlockchainTransaction({
     type: 'player_update',
     data: { experience: 25, level: 2 },
     walletAddress: player.walletAddress
   })
