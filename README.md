# üçØ Honeycomb Quest: The Digital Alchemist

A blockchain-powered crafting game that demonstrates the power of the **Honeycomb Protocol** for on-chain progression, player traits, and mission systems.

## üéÆ Game Concept

**Honeycomb Quest** is an alchemy-themed crafting game where players combine elemental forces (Fire, Water, Earth, Air) to create powerful artifacts. The game showcases how Honeycomb Protocol enables:

- **Verifiable mission systems** - Every crafting action creates on-chain missions
- **Programmable traits** - Player specializations evolve based on crafting choices
- **On-chain progression** - Experience, reputation, and achievements are permanently stored
- **Composable identity** - Player data is portable across any dApp

- **Honeycomb Integration**: Leaderboard data sourced from on-chain player records

## üêù Honeycomb Protocol Integration

### **Mission System**
```typescript
// Every crafting action creates a Honeycomb mission
const honeycombMission = await honeycombService.createMission({
  title: `Craft ${artifact.name}`,
  description: `Successfully crafted ${artifact.name} using ${artifact.elements.join(', ')} elements`,
  missionType: 'crafting',
  requirements: [],
  rewards: [{ type: 'artifact', value: artifact.id }]
})
```

### **Trait Evolution**
```typescript
// Player traits evolve based on crafting choices
const trait = await honeycombService.createTrait({
  name: 'Fire Master',
  description: 'Increased success rate with fire element crafting',
  traitType: 'fire_master',
  level: player.fireCraftingCount,
  maxLevel: 10,
  metadata: { playerAddress: walletAddress }
})
```

### **On-Chain Progression**
```typescript
// Player data synced with Honeycomb Protocol
await honeycombService.syncPlayerData(walletAddress, {
  level: player.level,
  experience: player.experience,
  reputation: player.reputation,
  artifacts: player.artifacts.length,
  missions: player.missions.filter(m => m.completed).length
})
```
